## Instructions
The format of this file is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/). It is processed by
scripts when generating a release, so please maintain the existing format.

Whenever you're preparing a significant commit, add a bullet list entry summarizing the change under the
[Unreleased](#unreleased) heading at the top. Entries should be grouped in sections based on the kind of change.
Please use the following sections, maintaining the same ordering. If the appropriate section isn't present yet,
just add it by copying from those below.

### Added
### Changed
### Deprecated
### Removed
### Fixed
### Security

When a new version is released, a script will turn the Unreleased heading into a new heading with appropriate values
for the version, date, and link. Then the script they will generate a new Unreleased section for future work.
Please keep the existing dummy heading and link as they are, so that things operate correctly. Thanks!
